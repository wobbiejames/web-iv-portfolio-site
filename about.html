                <p>Hello! Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. You can’t tell because this is the internet, but I’m blushing. Anyway my name is Robert James Taylor. Yes that's right: three first names! I am an emerging designer based in Lincoln, Nebraska and I am a recent graduate from the Graphic Design | Media Arts program at Southeast Community College. Through my education I have studied modern and historical design theory and practices. This knowledge has helped me to grow and shape myself into the designer that I am today. While I am proud of where I am, I know that design never stops, and I am eager to continue learning and growing!</p>
    
    <p>As a designer, I love building pieces from the ground up (sometimes literally) and find that I am most passionate about projects that I can leave a personal touch on. Design should be accessible to anyone, and as a designer I want to make work that is relatable and engaging.</p>
    <p>Please go check out my work here, and see what I have to offer and a designer! If you have any questions, feel free to get in touch <a href="contact.html">here</a>!</p>
